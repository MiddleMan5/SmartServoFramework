Documentation
-------------

You can dynamically generate a complete **API documentation** from the source code using Doxygen. This will prove very important in order to work efficiently with the framework. The documentation will be accessible through `doc/API_documentation.html`.

If you are running a macOS/Linux system you can easily generate the documentation from a terminal:
> $ cd SmartServoFramework/  
> $ doxygen Doxyfile  

If you have problems with the command line, it's just as easy to generate the documentation using DoxyWizard, Doxygen's GUI.
