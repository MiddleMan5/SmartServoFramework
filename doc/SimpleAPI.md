Simple API
----------

> Use this API to easily get/set values to your servos by sending simple synchronous instructions, then waiting for the answers!

### Advantages

- Synchronous API: VERY easy to use
- Basic set of instruction common to all Dynamixel and HerkuleX devices
- Validities of values and results are checked
- Easily access unique registers using specific call + register name

### Limitations

- Synchronous API: application will block while waiting for servo responses
- Harder to efficiently handle multiple servo models on the same bus
